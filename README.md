# PDF to TNS Converter

## Overview
This Python script converts PDF files into TNS files, suitable for use in Texas Instruments calculators. It extracts text and images from the PDF and saves them into a TNS file structure.

## Requirements
- Python 3.9
- PyPDF2 library (`pip install PyPDF2`)
- Pillow library (`pip install Pillow`)

## Usage
1. Install the required libraries if you haven't already: `pip install PyPDF2 Pillow`.
2. Place your PDF file(s) in the same directory as the script.
3. Run the script with the command: `python pdf_to_tns.py`.
4. Follow the on-screen prompts to enter the PDF file name and the desired TNS file name.

## Important Notes
- This script currently extracts text and images from the PDF. It saves text into a TXT file and images into separate PNG files.
- The script creates a basic structure for the TNS file. You may need to modify it to suit your specific TNS file requirements.
- Depending on the complexity of the PDF and the content types, further refinement of the script may be necessary to handle all cases effectively.
- For more information about TNS file structure and requirements, refer to the official documentation provided by Texas Instruments.
